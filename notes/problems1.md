# Problem Set 1

Everything was pretty straightforward except for problem 3 of the last set, I still don't quite get, even though thinking about it in terms of physically counting change in parallel with other instances of physically counting change makes good sense.

For given some amount and your set of coins, you can either add one of those coins or focus on the next coin. Think of a dude with his cash register open, at that moment, he becomes 2 dudes + registers, one of them grabs a coin and the other doesn't. Each of those dudes splits, and either looks at the next coin or adds the coin they were already looking at to the change pile. At the end of each long "branch", either the dude has made change, skipped all the coins, or can't make change using only his unskipped coins
