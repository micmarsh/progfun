#Lexical Scope

Basically the same as in js, (but not coffee!) so not much new. Although it's good to know about locally scoped variables in js + scala, I personally don't see it as a big issue, since you should name your variables different things in different functions, so coffee is cool.

The locally naming could have been important if you're defining component functions of some algorithm, but defining those in a "module" feels better (coming from js), unless inner functions are somehow optimized in scala (which they very well may be)
